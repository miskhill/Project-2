        <p> Hi! Thanks for visiting our Random Movie Generator!
          <br /><br />
                    We were given 48 hours to create a React single page application using a public API.
          <br /><br />
                      We chose the Movies Data Base as a great freely available API and chose to offer users the chance to search for movies!   
          <br /><br />
                        Styled using SCSS/Sass and the Bulma framework, we added custom animations and a responsive design.
          <br /><br />
